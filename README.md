# Communication_System

This course introduces the basic principles and analysis involved in analog communication. Also, introducing digital communication systems with the importance of sampling. This is essential for the understanding of advanced courses like wireless mobile communication systems.

##Course Outcomes
At the end of the course the student should be able to:

 1. Describe and analyze the mathematical techniques of generation, detection of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM) signals.

2. Mathematical representation of signals and types of noise using suitable distribution functions.

3. Evaluate the performance of various analog modulation schemes in the presence of noise.

4. Demonstrate, applying the concept of signal processing in communication theory using suitable simulation tool and hardware.

5. Identify the importance of sampling and understand various pulse modulation techniques.
